### Introduction
This is the interactive visualization in html of experiments comparing mixedviz to other visualization methods (t-SNE, UMAP, and starcoords2D with ULDA and OLDA) with simulated and real data.

### Instructions for interactive views
The 3D interative plots are implemented with the `rgl` functions and here are instructions for manipulation:
- Rotation: Click and hold with the left mouse button, then drag the plot to rotate it and gain different perspectives.
- Resize: Zoom in and out with the scroll wheel, or the right mouse button.
